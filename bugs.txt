Bugs: I did not complete the alpha like I wanted so I have to make that work first.
I will make the events effect the voters by iterating through each list and keep track of the new sizes of each map.
3rd update: tempList cannot erase as it is in a range-based loop. I need a iterator based loop. oops.
5th update: I noticed that the staunch population trackers would always increase when partyChange was zero even if the voter was already staunch. fixed it with a if statement.
