Bugs: I did not complete the alpha like I wanted so I have to make that work first.
I will make the events effect the voters by iterating through each list and keep track of the new sizes of each map.
3rd update: tempList cannot erase as it is in a range-based loop. I need a iterator based loop. oops.
5th update: I noticed that the staunch population trackers would always increase when partyChange was zero even if the voter was already staunch. fixed it with a if statement.
6th Update: I have made the display for the parties. However I suspect that they might be a bit skewed as a single vote from hihger up in the code could go through the event again in parties below it. I am not sure what to do about yet. maybe make a copy map? I'll deal with it later, but I am making a note of it.
10th update: There is a path in partyChange() that might not return an integer. I will apply a while loop to validate that the int is returned.
