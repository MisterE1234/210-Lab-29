Project Overview:
My project creates a voting simulation, a program designed to predict voting changes and patterns over the next 25 elections. This software will illustrate the impact of the leading party and national events have on the voting scene.
Implementation: 
I plan to use a std:map to store and manage data related to different voters across different voting divisions. This map will categorize voters into four std:lists representing two main parties, a independent group, and non-voters. The map's values will be an array of these four lists.
