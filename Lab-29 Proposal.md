Project Overview:
My project creates a voting simulation, a program designed to predict voting changes and patterns over the next 25 elections. This software will illustrate the impact of the leading party and national events have on the voting scene.
Implementation: 
I plan to use a std:map to store and manage data related to different voters across different voting divisions. This map will categorize voters into three std:lists representing left, moderate, and right political leanings. The map's values will be an array of these three lists.
One map entry would be for a left party.An additional map would be for a right party. Another map entry would be for a independent party. finally, a forth for non-voters.
Simulated events:
The simulation will focus on four events: An economic boom, an economic downturn, a disaster (natural or otherwise), and a war.
These events could effect voter perception and change their party affilation and voting pattern.
At anytime, any of these events could happen with the exculsivity of economic booms and downturn.
