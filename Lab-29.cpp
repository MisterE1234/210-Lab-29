//COMSC-210|Ethan Aylard|Lab-29
//IDE used: Visual Studio Code

//Include necessary headers for files, data structures, processing, and ect.

//Define a class named Voter:
    //would hold a int party variable with three options (1-3). To represent left, moderate, right.
    //an bool variable to see if the voter is staunch or not.
    //a partial constructor to have a custom party affiliation with staunch set false by default.

//Define a function that would simulate what event[s] would have happend for this voting period and how they affect different voters using a probabilty matrix.
    //Parameters: a voter, and a random int variable
    //returns: a number

//Define main function:
    //Initialize a map to store party information, each associated with its different kinds of voters.
    
    //Open a external file to read integer to the list to become voters.
        //if it does not open, print an error message and return -1.
    
    //Read data to lists: split three ways 30% R: 30% L: 40% I.
        // for each line extract a party affilation to make a voter.

    //close file
